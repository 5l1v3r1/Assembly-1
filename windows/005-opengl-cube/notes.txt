try experimenting with different window configurations (see what all the window types do)
try solving that annoying "Invalid window handle." error when loop is properly constructed

how to define the gl perspective (without glu)
  yes glu is old and an alternative should be sought
	  https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/GluPerspective_code
	it appears relatively simple to define the perspective matrix yourself, if you know the math
	and fortunately for me, i already spent the time to do just that in the past
		https://codepen.io/mikesmullin/pen/zNxoBL?editors=0010
	this will enable me to avoid using the GLU dependency

- try to get nasm to (in windows pe 64-bit executable):
	- render a spinning gl cube
    - render a gl triangle

notes:

- should make my own minimalist linker that reduces/reuses empty/unused space (97B)

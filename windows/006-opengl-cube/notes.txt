- try to get nasm to (in windows pe 64-bit executable):
	- render a spinning gl cube
	
how to define the gl perspective (without glu)
  yes glu is old and an alternative should be sought
	  https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/GluPerspective_code
	it appears relatively simple to define the perspective matrix yourself, if you know the math
	and fortunately for me, i already spent the time to do just that in the past
		https://codepen.io/mikesmullin/pen/zNxoBL?editors=0010
	this will enable me to avoid using the GLU dependency

TODO: output to log file in relative path instead of showing console window (and showing a console behind the normal window)

TODO: use the stack for all variables? like in macros build a stack frame reference
	so that important offsets are remembered and reusable with rsp offsets whether
	or not the code JMP or CALL several procs down the line
	but it may run into problems cuz it'd have to work inside a remote call to 
	same thread like WndProc
	maybe the one reserved .data is a base pointer
	i could probably figure out the rest from there statically at compile time
	but that would make all calls even register calls require two memory lookups
	which would be slower
	better think about this more
